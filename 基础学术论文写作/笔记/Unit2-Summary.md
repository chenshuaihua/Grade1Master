**1**.How to cite when writing the introduction?

approach 1: 100 papers , picking out of information of each (copy + paste)

approach 2: ==write introduction in your own words. THEN include references according to the points introduced(no copy + paste)==

**2**.How to read an academic paper efficiently , and analyze the logic of the articles.

Step1 : Why are you reading a paper? what information are you expecting to find ? which section are you most likely to find this information?(先想想自己阅读这篇文章的目的，想想自己想要获得什么信息，想想哪部分最可能有)

Step 2 : select the section, and focus on the information provided.

**3** Should we find a certain journal before writing a paper to fit in with the 
potential audience?
step 1: discuss with your supervisor/PI/mentor **what the most exciting
STORY of your work is** 
step 2: discuss **which journal** fits your story best (Scope of journal, IF)
step 3. organize the scaffold of your paper in line with **'Instructions to**
**the Author'**, and in line with **previously published articles** in the same
journal, and on a similar topic.

4.General structure of Discussion section 
**a**  ==summary sentence== (very short summary of main result, and whether
It is in line with your expectations)
**b** ==detailed discussion of each result== (compare to other studies, does
your result agree/disagree, why, reasons?problems?differences?)
**c**  ==limitations of your study? what questions have come up after your
study? what experiments should be done to answer those questions?==
**d** conclusion: ==what is the new understanding== that comes from your
Work? why should readers study your paper? how has your study
changed the current model?



whether (if) 表示“是否”，that 却不表示任何含义。在它们所引出的从句中，that 表示一种肯定、明确的概念，而 whether (if) 则表示一种不肯定、不明确的概念。

that与whether(how / what )引导名词从句时不能并存。

例如：The news that weather we will go camping tomorrow was not announced.是错误的。

应该改成 The news whether we will go on a trip/journey tomorrow is not /has not been announced.
