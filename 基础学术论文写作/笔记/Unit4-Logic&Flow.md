Your thinking is complex, but writing is linear.

## 4.1Logic

整体逻辑：四类可选择的逻辑规律

### general to specific structures ：

general statement→ elaboration on statement → more detailed elaboration→ border statement

found in ==Introduction==(beginning)



opening with general statements

- can include statements of FACT or TOPIC (true or not )

Function of general statements  最重要的就是降低阅读难度

- To `erase` your reader into your writing
- if too challenging,reader lost from the beginning

到底是generalization 还是definition

- generalization对于专家或非专家都更能接受

- definition 比general statements 更technical

  读者的类型决定了！



opening with (shocking) statistics

- 能很快激起读者的兴趣



specific to general structure

- end of ==abstract==
- end of ==discussion== section

both G->S and S->G found in abstract 





### Problem-Solution Structure

- mainly Results and Discussion

- also present in Abstract and Introduction

  

- P->S texts: argumentative and evaluative

#### Grammer elements

* mid-position Adverbs

* -ing Clauses(从句) of Result

  very useful 

  例子：

  Problem： Price rise,(thus) increasing the chance of hyperinflation

  Solution: Price rise,(thus) increasing earnings that can then be invested in the enterprise

* Indirect questions



#### Tenses

Result Section , 两个都可以用

- active voice + past tense( We did ...)

- passive voice + past tense (As shown in Fig.1 ,...)

Discussion Section

- Both active and passive voice 
- past tense (previous reports showed ...) and
- present tense(On the basis of our results, we propose...)



#### Indirect questions (间接的问题)

1) explainging purpose 

A questionnaire was distributed **in order to determine whether...**

2)used to 'problematize' issues, cases, phennomena, statements.



Adversative sentence connectors(转折句子连接词）

**However**，this system/process/idea has various problems.

**Nevertheless**, few solutions have been found to ...

**Despite this**, little progress has been made in ...

**Nevertheless**, the problem remains as to how ....

**However**, there remains the issue of reliability.



#### Introducing the Solution

Examples:

1)One interesting solution to this problem is now being tested in the village of ...

2)One approach currently under study involves transplanting healthy coral into a bleached reef.

3)Solution to this problem are now widely discussed.

4)One method to address this difficulty is to...



#### Process structure

**Methods ** section of your manuscript all about ==process==

过程描述：

a)describing the parts of a process as the steps required to provide a solution



**language Focus:verbs and agents in the solution**

agent...施事性名词

passive voice 被动语态   important role in process descriptions

examples: Three strains - grown separately and harvested

==用被动语态的话能够将重点放在过程上==，而如果用主动语态，重心就会转移到技术人员上了

要求==no agent, use of passive voice and past tense==

注意：==要避免一词多义/模棱两可==  prevent ambiguities



**Flow of ideas in a process description** 

1.The liquid is collected, and **then** kept for 24 hours.



**Active voice in process Descriptions** 

nowadays also uesd for ==human activities==, especially in **the beginning of each Reults Section**



### **总结**

方法部分，用被动语态和过去时态

结果部分，混合使用被动语态和主动语态

Mix  and match different tools for ensuring good flow.





## 4.2Flow

细节表达：连接词、标点、重复、时间状语、总结词、从句增强流畅性。



### Linking words and phrases 

![](E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-linking words.PNG)



![](E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-linking words examples.PNG)

#### Problem 1：

in contrast （与此相反，主要来进行比较）和 On the contrary（正相反，表示强调一个东西）的比较

![](E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-contrast比较.PNG)



#### Problem 2：

==Meanwhile==  usually not for academic writing 

meanwhile :in the intervening period of time/ at the same time

![](E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-meanwhile.PNG)





#### where to place "While"

用的地方要有对比。

建议将while放在beginning

![](E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-while.PNG)



#### Summary

- use linker phrases whenever they can improve the flow
- use the most appropriate linker phrases to establish a clear and logical link between your statements.
- remember that the use of linking phrases differs somewhat between chinese and english



### Punctuation (标点符号)

full stops(句号),comma(逗号), semicolon(分号),colon(冒号)



**full stops** :

它们不会打断思路，相反，它们会帮助读者阅读更加顺畅

**try to use as many  full stops as you can**   use them generously!



**commmas**:     linker后面什么时候应该加逗号？learn by eaxmples.

used for clauses(The book, which is rare, cannot be found in the library)

used for lists

often used with subordinators(主从连词，从属连词)        **danger of losing your line of argument when overused.**



**semicolon**:

join two completely independent sentences.

can be used with sentence connectors(; however, ;thus, ; for example)

used to break up longer sentences    **only use them occasionally**



**colon**:

used to introduce a list      **avoid overuse when formulating a clear scientific thought**



**总结**：

避免写长句，尽可能多的使用句号

在必要的时候才使用逗号，每句<3个



### Conjuncitons(连词,连接词)

<img src="E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-conjunctions.PNG" style="zoom:60%;" />

**Problem1: use of conjunctions at the beginning of a sentence**

将BUT / AND 等词语在学术写作中替换掉

BUT：**In contrast/However/Unexpectedly/Surprisingly**

AND:   **In addition/Also/Furthermore/Importantly**

THOUGH: ==Only use after comma== as part of a clause(even though )



**Problem2:Using 'and' to connect unrelated facts**

可能用and连接的两句话没有因果关系

<img src="E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-conjunctions-example2.PNG" style="zoom:60%;" />



总结：

* use the most appropriate linker phrases to establish a logical link between your statements

* ==do not use conjunctions two sentenes?==  ??????

- 读论文的时候看作者是如何连接idea,thought,和arguments的



xddd

### Repetition

<img src="E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-repetition.PNG" style="zoom:60%;" />

passive verb ->  -ed adjective

was selected -> selected  strain

was purified -> purified strains

单词的重复不是问题，相反，能提高清晰度和准确度



### Time Adverbials

once,first,next,then,finally...

order of events

<img src="E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-time adverbials.PNG" style="zoom:67%;" />





### -ing clauses

Prices rise,thus leading to a decrease in demand.

表示第一句和第二句的关系

emphasize cause  and effect

used in combination with "thus"(optional)

render your statement more dynamic 

very common in academic writing



Problem of ambiguity(模棱两可) when used > 2 times in one sentence

used with caution( ~ once per sentence)



### This + Summary words

phrase that summarizes what has already been mentioned in the preceding sentence.

<img src="E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-this+summary1.PNG" style="zoom:67%;" />

**understanding** 



<img src="E:\研究生\研一\上半学年\基础学术论文写作\图片\Unit4-this+summary2.PNG" style="zoom:60%;" />

**situation**

要选择合适的summary word！



==this==， caution！ 这个是什么意思？ 

THIS sometimes used “unsupported” By noun

BEWARE：only do so if it is absolutely clear what THIS refers to!

理想情况下总是用合适的概括名词来表达“THIS”





## 4.3 Discussion:Logic and Flow

**1.**Many native writers do not use linkers, why should I ? Which linker is the best?

连接词是建立陈述之间逻辑联系的唯一方式

for non-native speakers:make use of all tools available

remember:clarity and logic priority , not elegance

Practice! Practice! Practice!



**2.**How can i translate my Chinese writing into English and still follow the logical flow in ENglish?



 Tips:

- read!read! read! original books and papers

- Write, Wrting in English

- Revise(修订) 写完英文论文以后，要进行修改

  opinions：clear?

  materials: logical?

  structure: arrangement of opinions and materials

  language:Concise ,Precise and coherence(连贯性/条理性)



long-term solution: read English-written papers with focus on logical structure.

短期解决方法：将中文翻译为英文，然后对应地重新安排句子

实用建议: try to identify the different structures discussed in this unit:G->S，S->G P-S, process ,in the  sections of the paper.



3.What should i do when finding out after writing that the logical flow is missing?

- Write your statements first, then improve the logic and flow
- Tip1. Re-read your paragraph with focus on logic and flow, and mark the linkers in your writing.
- TIp2. Try to use sentence patterns we share to re-write your sentences , and keep accumulate during reading good papers.
- Tips3. Ask co-authors or friends  to read and leave comments.



4.How practical are these tips provided in this unit？ Is logic not different for each research field? 



- at a fundamental level: Question -> Inquiry -> Analysis   **fundamenally there is no difference**

- at discipline level: approach to obtaining Results different (experimental/theoretical?) **there are differences when we obtain results**  (实现还是理论)

- at journal level: presentation of Q/I/A different ,historical reasions     

  有区别 have to look  at the journal in which you want to publish to konw what kind of  sections you have in the paper what kind of information need to go where, 这是我们必须要知道的

对每个想写academic paper的人几乎都一样。
