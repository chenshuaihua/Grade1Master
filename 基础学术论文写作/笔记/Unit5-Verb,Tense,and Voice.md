## 5.2 Verb and Adverb

### 5.2.1Verb shift

动词短语 phrasal verb

介词动词 prepositional verb

学术写作中，动词一般都会换为单动词形式(single verb forms)

例子：

keep up →maintain

go to → approach

make up → constitute 

go down → decrease

go up → increase

那我怎么知道一个单词是formal还是informal？

### 5.2.2 Verb Use

#### **lazy  verbs**:

- avoid weak,vague, lazy verbs

  Examples: **have,do be**

### 5.2.3 Adverbs

Informal English : adverb at **start or end** of a sentence.

## 5.3 Using Verb in Practice

**Q1**.what verb can be used ,which one cannot?

a. read papers, journals. focus on language , not just content.

b. take notes ,write down examples ,prepare your own word list.

c. after reading 100+ papers in your field of research ,you will see the number of verbs used is limited to 20 to 30.

 对照表的使用

尽量避免使用的lazy word :

let, get, put , to do, to be , to have, make(things better), take,  works, can , could,

**Q2**, 过去，推荐使用被动语态与突出客体，而现在==**要多用主动语态**==，what has changed?

a. Active voice now preferred, much more engaging AND more precise( who did what to whom?)

b. Pay attention to CURRENT use of language.

b. language changes everyday, pay attention to writing styles of more recently published papers.



**Q3**,这单元说的points 是hard grammar rules吗还是惯例?

==**不是hard grammar, 注意conventions**==

Language（rules + conventions） is different to MATH(rules)

All disciplines expect you to apply the same grammar rules,but each discipline follows its own conventions.

我们已经学了十多年英语语法，现在需要pay attention to the conventions used in your own discipline(领域), using the knowledge acquired in this course as guidance.





不能在句子开头用AND／BUT
