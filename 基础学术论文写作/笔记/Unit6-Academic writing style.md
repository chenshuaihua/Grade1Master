The vocabulary shift:

a lot of -> considerable



## 2.Run-on expressions(流水句)

examples: etc. ; and so on; and so forth

*tend to be vague and imprecise

*reader needs to fill in the ...(blanks)

*more common in social science publications

*common in popular science essays

*uncommon in original(natural) sciences publications

*sometimes used in social sciences publications

READING , with focus  on both content and grammar



## 4.Pronouns(代词)

**Use of personal pronoun 'I'**

在自然科学的论文写作中，用 I 会显得太informal ，

而在社会科学中，单一作者很常见，因此使用 I ，也就可以

**Use of personal pronoun ‘We /Our’**

'We / Our' now widely accepted in academic writing:

In this paper , ==we argue== that small incentives result in greater participation in surveys.

-> ==active voice used== 

**Use of personal pronoun 'you'**

examples:

**不要用 you **

You can see the results in table 1. -> 在原创的科学出版物中很少见

More formal way:

The results can be seen in table 1.

->==shift from active voice -> passive voice==



## 5.Style : Questions

如何提出问题？

<u>avoid using direct questions: Why? What? When? Where? How? Does...?</u>

直接提出问题在学术出版物中很少见

more common in social sciences 

also used in review articles 

-> 要把direct questions 变为 indirect questions



Examples:

What can be done to lower the costs for patients? -> ==It is necessary to== consider how costs for patients may be  lowered

Why has antibiotic resistance increased in the past decade? -> ==Several studies have investigated  why== antibiotic resistance has  increased in the past decade.
 或者 ==It is important to understand== why antibiotic resistance has increased in the past decade.



## 6.Economic Word  Usage

use <u>as many words</u> to express your thoughts as necessary , and <u>as few as possible</u> without losing clarity of thought.



Examples：

There are some materials of inorganic origin that can be used by bioengineers in the process of  tissue engineering that have been shown to be very promising indeed ->   Certain inorganic materials have shown potential for tissue engineering.



## 7.Discussion

Q1:有一些文章使用 run-on,direct questions 等，那为什么我还还要关注这些语言细节呢?

并不是所有文章都是完美无缺，高IF的文章有更高的质量，我们可以读本专业领域的好文章建立自己的library，而注意那些语言细节，是为了让所有读者能够理解到完全相同的信息。



Q2：使用direct questions 还是indirect questions？

看本专业



Q3:写论文很难同时兼顾内容和style，那什么样的写作习惯是最好的呢？

首先，内容是最重要的，你要保证你写的论文逻辑连贯，写完之后可以再去关注style，linker等的问题(比如，可以让所有共同作者一起来讨论，或者找native speaker 来协助，以使得文章与本领域的写作惯例相符合)

==write in English ,but use notes to lead re-write==
